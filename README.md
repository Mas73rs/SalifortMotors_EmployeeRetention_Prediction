# Predicting Employee Retention at Salifort Motors: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview

* **Problem Statement:** This project aims to predict the likelihood of employee attrition at Salifort Motors, a hypothetical automotive company. Employee retention is critical for the long-term success and stability of the business, making it a top priority for HR and management.
* **Data Used:** The dataset used for this project comprises HR records for employees at Salifort Motors, including variables such as age, department, job satisfaction, and years at the company. The dataset contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below. 

Variable  |Description |
-----|-----|
satisfaction_level|Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0&ndash;1]|
last_evaluation|Score of employee's last performance review [0&ndash;1]|

## Business Understanding

The success of any organisation heavily relies on the retention of its skilled employees. High turnover rates result in increased recruitment and training costs and lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and decreased overall productivity. In the case of Salifort Motors, understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the automotive industry.
For this project, the primary stakeholders are the Human Resources department and the executive leadership team at Salifort Motors. The aim is to develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving the company, thereby allowing for targeted retention strategies.
